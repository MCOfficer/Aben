	description `One of the Abens' more accomplished works, an incredibly dense battery array that outclasses batteries of human design by almost double the capacity. All districts run off of the city electrical grid as a primary supply and have additional Distributors as a secondary supply in the event of a crisis, there are multiple fail safes to maintain working order throughout the capital in any event.`

	description `The largest manufactured reactor by the Aben is the G-82 Station, designed to generate enough power to support a typical residential district in the capital on its own. There are various locations where there are up to a half dozen of these Stations in general proximity as a local supply for the city-wide electrical grid. These locations are allowed up to three times the typical building allowance for P-26 Screens, as it doesn't need explaining why it's so important that these locations are adequately defended.`
