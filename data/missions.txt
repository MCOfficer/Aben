			`On the descent down into a large sprawling crater, a great shimmering spire at the center of a breathtaking city casts an intense glare in all directions. The beautiful sight of the city surrounding the spire puts you in awe, the buildings seem well-maintained and have ease of access by air, or ground. The swarming layers of hover vehicles above it all are incredible, they must run autonomously as they all traverse the airspace fluidly and with very little room for error.`
			`	Near the pinnacle of the spire, which tapers off into a gentle slope, lies an unexpectedly large opening with flashing strips marking landing areas within the hanger. Upon landing your ship within, a party of four approaches you shortly after you disembark, they appear to be mostly human-like figures, only unclothed. On approach, it's clear that they possess no obvious reproductive organs, bear no hair across their bodies, and are missing noses. The relief you feel from being confronted by figures with a similar physicality is almost entirely shaken by the striking differences in their appearance.`
			`	As they reach you, you notice that the two adjacent to the center individual bear an unusual build, it seems they are clad in body armor designed to mimic their already imposing build. The last of the four appear to be female or at least a separate breed of the species that is very slim, and at least a head taller than the others. 'Her' ears stretch to a point, much like a mythical race from old earth legends. She holds an electronic device that you assume is for transcribing the conversation, "It is a wonderful and clear day sir, or ma'am of course. We call ourselves Aben." the spokesperson opens with, he sounds almost cautious when pronouncing mention of gender.`
			choice
				`	"How are we understanding each other?"`
				`	"When did you learn to speak with my kind?"`
			`	He plainly explains, "We have met travelers from your people before, they were kind to lend us multiple databases of text and literature in your native tongue." he hesitates, perhaps to articulate his thoughts, looking posed to deliver a rehearsal of speech, "We the Aben are a modest race, we can not rule over others with our feeble technology or live in peace with those who would rule us, we are homebound by culture. To gain power as other great civilizations have before us, we adapt the works of others for our use. Many oblige us with their favor, we have received a great many deliveries of exciting applications, and they of course get their return for their service."`
			choice
				`	"How do you determine what technology you can use?"`
				`	"Can I get involved with your deliveries?"`
					goto "involved"
			`	"We are interested in any of which mechanisms we don't currently understand, there are establishments for determination of use." After a brief pause, the spokesperson introduces themself, "For the matter of personal relations my designation, or name as you might say, is Saed. May I learn your name?"`
			branch "hero"
				has "main plot completed"
			`	"I call myself <first> <last>, I'm the captain of my own ship." Pausing to consider what exactly you do before you answer, "I travel further than the rest of my kind are able. I am witness to many of our galaxy's wonders, one individual explorer helping where I can."`
				goto "named"
			label "hero"
			`	"My name is Captain <last>, I led the forces of my kind against the invasive Pug and together drove them away. I'm just an explorer now, but I once pledged allegiance and fulfilled my duty to a smaller part of the whole of my kind."`
			label "named"
			`	Saed looks pleased, although the expression feels muted and askew due to their lack of a nose, "I am happy to meet your acquaintance <last>. If you too would like to assist us you can inquire in an amount of 8 of your standard day cycles, we are unfortunate to be busy at this time."`
				accept
			label "involved"
			`	Expressions are somewhat muted on the Aben it seems, you never considered how much expression is conveyed through the movements in the nose. You can pick up an inkling of a surprise after your offer to help, "Gracious visitor, you would be welcome. We are however busy for a time, you can return at any time after an amount of 4 of your standard day cycles are passed."`

			`Landing in the spacious hanger as you have before still feels as new an experience. The cavernous hanger, as empty and immaculate as any ventured before, is isolating; the entire structure you stand in now feels newly established, though you do not know truly how long the Aben, or this structure, has persisted.`
			`	Without so long to wait, you find yourself once again to face with the spokesperson and his scribe. "Are you here to participate in our acquisitions? I will personally court you in the proceeding registering."`
			`	"I am, Saed. Anything I can do to help."`
			`	A short journey ensues out of the hanger, just a floor below by elevator is another spacious room, a warehouse of a sort. The vast open-plan display of equipment both known and unknown to you along the floors lends credence to the entire operation. You feel as if a machine of unseen magnitude has just revealed the cogs of its mechanisms, gearing for some grandiose purpose.`
			`	After a select few tours of their operations on various sorts of equipment, both space-borne and earth-bound, you are guided through several trials in the procedure. A deceptively long process leaves you picking up the pieces well after you decompress in your ship, though the actual necessities of their operation aren't much more than some courier work over long distances.`

			`	Saed appears in the device as a projection, as the box turns translucent. The contract as described personally by Saed is quite simple; a Jump Drive has near only been reported in possession of a species with very advanced technological achievement, and hostile action is strongly discouraged. As there are limited options, no direction can be provided, however, cases of individual ownership are not unknown.`

			`This time when searching for available contracts, you are cut short by a blaring announcement coming from somewhere within the hanger. It's not a surprise that you never noticed anything resembling a loudspeaker, but you are surprised it's so noticeable within the cockpit of your ship.`
			`	It's a request for you, specifically, to depart your ship and to accompany escorts out of the hanger. The voice from the announcement sounds like Saed, your regular correspondent within the Aben. Sure enough, the announcement ends with signage from Saed, which sounds incredibly out of place in a verbal context.`
			`	You exit your ship and are instantly set face-to-face with two armored guards, much like your very first visit to Nis. You've never engaged anyone other than Saed before, but the guards seem interested; "<last>, we will escort you out, as Saed instructs us."`

			label "saed"
			`	Much like the underfloor workshop, hiding so close to an otherwise isolated hanger, your escorts only lead you a short distance to a small room with a large console central to it. Saed enters immediately after your party approaches the console, your two escorts are soon after dismissed.`
			`	"Hello again <last>, I'm sorry for taking time away from you but I feel it necessary to find the source of your generosity. The chase is that you've supplied us with an unexpected number of our requested Jump Drives, it would be helpful to us to understand your source."`

				goto "wrapUp"
			label "pug"
			`	"I've fought the Pug for this technology, they meddle and they manipulate. I can overwhelm their ships to take their precious tools."`
			`	The tension in the room rises with the deafening pause following your admission. Saed eventually lets his thoughts reach you, "Your callous disregard for them, why do you condemn them?"`
			`	"The Pug interfered in a civil war my kind needed to resolve on our own, under a guise of presentiment. They presented themselves as an enemy to unite us against and it worked." Saed looks confused, perhaps earlier tempted to accept your offense at their interference. "Why do you still fight them, if they had helped you stop fighting yourselves?" he asks, somewhat disjointedly.`
			`	"Because our wars are not their problem to fix, and we lost so many lives trying to take back the worlds they stole from us."`
			label "wrapUp"

We've been told about them from the visitors we've had and we consider them allies even without having met them. Still, your business is your own and we won't betray your trust in telling us, but we won't risk angering aliens that can't be fought away."`
			`	(Your hostility with the Quarg isn't acceptable to the Aben, they will not offer you any more jobs.)`
