			`On your descent to the shining capital of the Aben, you notice a flare blowing in the sky, shot from the surface. You decide to investigate before docking, but it could be out of your jurisdiction as a trader.`
			choice
				`	(Investigate.)`
			`	You follow the intense glare of the flare and the fading plume of its' tail. Your monitors show from surface scans that there is a massive corpse strewn across the landscape, seemingly as large as a building and knocking down many towering trees at the edge of a forest. There is a gathering of tents established alongside the underbelly of the beast with figures regularly conducting tests on the corpse.`
			`	The flat base of a nearby cliffside serves as your landing area for the moment. You make the trip over to the site and notice when closer that they are wearing what is presumably breathing implements, they cover the mouth and ears sleekly, almost like a decor mask with straps behind the neck and top of their heads.`
			`	At first you are ignored and worked around but are soon collected by another, who seems to be supervising the operation. You follow the supervisor into a tent where they find a large cube and place it onto the ground in between you two. Brightly diffused lights along the side shine from the bottom and climb up the cube before a hologram appears above, the display is not unlike a glitchy video game character coming into focus, going from blocky pixels to sharp details in no time.`
			`	Struck by the outfit worn in the hologram, you recognise Saed and share a brief moment of thoughtful silence. Saed begins, "Hello Partner, much like the devices used to convey contracts to our partners, these holograms are trusted to the possession of supervisory personnel to avoid communication failures in such situations."`
			`	"I'm sure you're wondering what you arrived upon in the Exclusion, why have you visited that site?" Saed asks without wait`
			choice
				`	"I was curious about the flare."`
				`	"What's the Exclusion?"`
					goto "exclusion"
			`	"Flares are often used at regular intervals to signify active areas of interest, a basic approach but it works to attract the attention of passing ships effectively."`
			`	You can't help but feel like a moth to a flame after having your question answered. "So what is the interest here?" you ask.`
			label "exclusion"
			`	"Regrettably, our planet has few but troublesome elusive areas that are unsuitable to sustain life. Within these Exclusions lie ancient devices with no traceable origin, the areas surrounding these buried devices are unpredictably bathed with intense waves of photonic radiation that can be disastrous for organisms that approach the epicenter."`
			`	Our only way to find these devices currently is by encountering the danger, or by finding evidence of it within the growth patterns of certain aged flora.`
			`	"Is that what happened here, to this animal?" you ask, already sure that it is.`
			`	Saed responds in kind "This animal, was our idol, Yrahn. The animals of our planet live extraordinary rich lives, and deserve reverence for their constancy."`
			choice
				`	"Can I help to remove the device?"`
			`	"I appreciate your offer Partner, I'll need transport for the excavated device once secured within a safe enclosure. Please standby while we prepare the device for transport."`

			`You land at the spire as instructed and are met with a crew standing at attention behind Saed, "Welcome back, please allow my crew to remove the device from your ship."`
			`	The courtesy of the request is washed away by the crew springing into action, without time for you to reply. Once loaded with the device, a platform lowers the device to the research floor below, and an empty platform returns shortly after, leaving no obvious seam in the floor for where it lies.`
			`	"Thank you for your service, it was a short journey but you prevented a larger effort on our part. We can transfer a payment of 40 thousand credits to you for the inconvenience."`
